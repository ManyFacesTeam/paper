    "Centrality of the face in human perception & in research Variety of social perception & recognition topics that use face stimuli Importance of open & transparent methods, current limits for this in terms of stimuli currently\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Existing face databases\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A wealth of face stimulus databases exist, created for varying purposes. Many of these are available for research use (see e.g., face image meta-database to search many of these) Many studies use the same stimulus databases (e.g., CFD, AFD, Karolinska – check citations of the big ones)\n",
    "-   This can cause issues in terms of generalisability\n",
    "-   Participants online may become familiar with frequently used stimuli\n",
    "-   Other studies use stimuli they collect themselves but cannot necessarily share for ethical reasons\n",
    "-   These are often not well-documented, creates an issue for transparency & replication attempts (can cite Grim Image preprint)\n",
    "-   There are also limitations in terms of many databases’ diversity of stimuli (e.g., many include only White or Western targets/models)\n",
    "-   Recent databases are improving on this (e.g., Hawaii face database, mixed-race database – check Zotero for recent saved papers)\n",
    "-   Crucially, most databases are static. Once collected, the number of stimuli available does not change. (exception: CFD)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The current work\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Sought to address the limitations of existing databases\n",
    "-   Collected face images in the lab for experimental control & to have associated demographic data + from consenting individuals\n",
    "-   Vs scraping images from online\n",
    "-   Developed a reproducible and openly-available protocol for face image collection, collecting multiple images per target/model to benefit a wide array of possible research areas/questions\n",
    "-   Transparently documents the process of image collection\n",
    "-   Enables reproducibility\n",
    "-   The database can be added to in the future (i.e., it will not be static)\n",
    "-   Collected images following the protocol in 20 different labs across the world\n",
    "-   specify \\# of countries, world regions (compare to existing databases?)\n",
    "-   Diverse set of models (more so than possible to collect at just one lab)\n",
    "-   Recruited online perceivers to rate a subset of the images (i.e., front-facing images) to generate norming data\n",
    "-   Make the database available for future research\n",
    "-   Altogether, we introduce a new, diverse, openly-available face stimulus set that will continue to grow in the future. We hope that this will broaden the generalisability of findings in face perception and recognition research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2 Study/phase 1: Pprotocol development & stimulus collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Method\n",
    "\n",
    "For both studies/phases, the University of Glasgow provided ethical approval. We obtained additional local ethical approval at collaborating institutions where required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Protocol Development\n",
    "\n",
    "The team developed and pre-tested a protocol for collecting standardised and reproducible images of faces for use in research. Following a survey among the ManyFaces team, we constructed the protocol for collection of a variety of images that would be useful for a broad variety of research questions. Specifically, we included images varying in their standardisation of appearance (standardised and unstandardised, e.g., white t-shirt and hair pulled back vs. clothing and hair as worn by the participant/model on that day), viewing angle (frontal, profile, ¾), and facialemotion expression (neutral, natural, angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad, surprised).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to beginning data collection, the team pre-tested the protocol to ensure clarity of instructions and consistency of images collected across sites. We revised details within the protocol to resolve issues that arose (e.g., revised facial expression emotion elicitation instructions, clarified camera settings). The final protocol can be found at \\[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D9TPGXCgTRZi7nqEIg6jb42R4gNQx9L3qasg8tFvu1I/edit?usp=sharing\\]. In sum, the protocol detailed the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Image Types. The protocol defined the categories of images in terms of their standardisation of appearance, viewing angle, and facial expression.\n",
    "-   Standardisation of Appearance. In the standardised images models wore a white t-shirt, had their hair pulled back or covered, included no adornments/accessories (excepting those that could not be removed for cultural reasons), and wore minimal or no makeup. In contrast, unstandardised images showed models in their own clothing, with their hair as they came into the lab, and with adornments excepting glasses or anything obscuring the face or neck.\n",
    "-   Viewing Angle. Full frontal portraits showed models facing the camera, left and right profile portraits showed each side of models’ faces in profile, and left and right ¾ portraits showed models’ faces at a 45-degree angle from the axis of the camera.\n",
    "-   Facial Expression. Neutral images were of models refraining from making any facial expression, natural images displayed a natural expression for the model, and each facial expression of emotion displayed the expression the model would make if they were feeling the specified emotion (e.g., happiness).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Image Prioritisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol specified which images to take (i.e., the combinations of appearance standardisation, viewing angle, and emotion expression), in what order, and which were most crucial to collect if researchers were under time constraints. The order of image collection was as follows, with starred (\\*) images prioritised/required for each model:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Exposure calibration photo\\*\n",
    "-   Identification & calibration photo\\*\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Natural - Full frontal portrait\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Neutral - Full frontal portrait\\*\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Neutral - Left and Right profile portraits\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Neutral - Left and Right ¾ portraits\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Happy - Full frontal portrait\\*\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Happy - Left and Right profile portraits\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - Happy - Left and Right ¾ portraits\n",
    "-   Unstandardized - All other expressions (in random or appropriate order) - Full frontal portrait\n",
    "-   Standardized - Natural - Full frontal portrait\n",
    "-   Standardized - Neutral - Full frontal portrait\\*\n",
    "-   Standardized - Neutral - Left and Right profile portraits\\*\n",
    "-   Standardized - Neutral - Left and Right ¾ portraits\\*\n",
    "-   Standardized - Happy - Full frontal portrait\\*\n",
    "-   Standardized - Happy - Left and Right profile portraits\n",
    "-   Standardized - Happy - Left and Right ¾ portraits\n",
    "-   Standardized - All other expressions (in random or appropriate order) - Full frontal portrait\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers with additional time could also capture the other expressions at different viewing angles (Left/Right profile, ¾) with either unstandardized or standardized appearance, as well as a video of standardized appearance to test out 3D image capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.3 Equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "All collaborating sites/labs used the same set of equipment. Images were captured using a Canon EOS 250d (also called Canon EOS Rebel SL3 in some regions) camera with Canon 18-55mm IS STM lens, and lit by an LED Ring light (Fovitec Bi-Colour LED 18” Ring Light) on a stand. Colour calibration was via a Calibrite colourChecker Classic card. The image collection space had a white background with a chair for models to sit in. Researchers provided white t-shirts for models to wear for standardised images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.4 Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup of the room used for image collection at each site required removing or minimising outside light sources (e.g., using a windowless room, turning off overhead lights) and colour spill. The protocol specified the distances at which to set up the chair for models to sit in relative to the white background and the lighting and camera rig. Camera setup instructions including the specified shooting mode, shutter speed, aperture, ISO, white balance, and colour space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.5 Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the protocol detailed how to prepare and position models and how to take each kind of images listed in the image prioritisation section. This included the positioning of the model’s head for each viewing angle and facial expression elicitation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Stimulus Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the protocol, 20 labs (1 in Austria, 2 in Brazil, 2 in Canada, 2 in Germany, 1 in Israel, 3 in Malaysia, 1 in Mexico, 1 in the Netherlands, 1 in Serbia, 4 in the UK, and 2 in the US) \\[note \\# of labs per country\\] collected images of an average of 10 models per site. As specified by the protocol, researchers collected multiple images of each model, within the time constraints of the study session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models furthermore completed a demographic questionnaire via Experimentum, reporting their age, gender, ethnicity, height, and weight. They also reported whether or not they were wearing makeup (specifying what kinds, e.g., foundation, eye makeup, semi-permanent makeup) and whether they had ever experienced anything that could affect the shape of their face (e.g., broken nose, cosmetic surgery or injections, orthodontic work) and specified this if they were willing.… Finally, they completed a debriefing questionnaire asking them about their experience of posing for the images (e.g., whether instructions were clear, whether any part of the process was uncomfortable). Results\n",
    "\n",
    "211 total models provided their images, following withdrawals and exclusions for poor image quality. <a href=\"#tbl-images-per-type\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 1</a> details the number of models for Detail resulting number of models from each site \\[after exclusions for photo quality & model withdrawals\\], number of each kind of photo. collected"

    "For data cleaning, we first downloaded and reshaped the raw data from Experimentum. In the next step, we ensured that the models’ gender, race/ethnicity, and units of height and weight were consistently formatted across labs. For gender and race/ethnicity, words presented in languages other than English were recoded to be presented in English (e.g., “mulher” to “female”, “preta” to “Black”). We then classified self-described race/ethnicity into one of seven categories (“White”, “Black”, “Asian”, “Indigenous”, “MENA” (Middle Eastern or North African), “Latine”, or “Mixed”), where possible. Descriptions that could not be clearly sorted into these categories were given “Ambiguous label” (non-entries were recoded as NA). For height, we ensured all data were presented in centimetres, and for weight, we ensured that all data were presented in kilograms. Models could report height and weight in metric or imperial units, so we converted from imperial to metric where required. We also sanity-checked the reported units, assuming heights \\> 100 to be in centimetres and those \\< 100 to be in inches, and weights \\< 80 to be in kilograms. Any non-entries of height or weight for a model was recoded as NA."

    "\n",
    "We next obtained perceptions/ratings of a subset of the photos (front-facing) to validate the emotion expressions (their perceived emotion category and intensity) and collect norming data on central social perceptions, namely perceived attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness, gender-typicality, memorability, and age. We chose these ratings due to their central importance in the person perception, face recognition, and emotion perception literatures (e.g., Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008; Sutherland et al., 2013; Perrett, 2010; –add emotion & memorability/recognition cites–). We preregistered this study on the OSF (<https://osf.io/4d5v9>).\n",

    "\n",
    "RAW images were processed using webmorphR (https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/j2754), which facilitates scriptable processing of images using imagemagick; a full script of the processing steps is available at REPO LINK. Briefly,\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each face was delineated using the Face++ automatic face detection algorithm to generate a 106-point template.\n",
    "-   All images were resized to 1000w by 1500h pixels to standardise size (two different RAW formats were used, which resulted in two different image sizes)\n",
    "-   The median RGB colour value of a 100x100 pixel patch at the upper left corner was calculated to fill in any edges from alignment.\n",

The 201 identities with emotion images were divided into six groups of up to 34 images, and each counterbalanced condition showed a different emotion for each of the six groups, such that no identity was shown more than once to each rater.

    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.4 Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "We collected ratings via Experimentum (DeBruine et al., 2020); structure files for the exact experimental setup are available at REPO. After a brief introduction to the study and online informed consent, each participant (rater) was randomly allocated to one of the ratings (e.g., rating all 205 standardised neutral faces on how memorable they look). All available faces were displayed one at a time, in a randomised order for each rater. The question/prompt and response scale remained visible at the top of the screen, above the photo throughout the study. The study automatically progressed to the next trial once the rater responded by clicking on the response scale. There was no time limit to provide a response. We included seven attention checks embedded in the study, which directed raters to provide a specific response. Following rating or categorising all stimuli, raters self-reported their gender, age, race/ethnicity, country of residence, and device type used for the study (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile). They also completed an honesty/attention check question, asking them if they engaged with the study seriously, with assurance of payment regardless of response (choosing from ‘no, I was not really paying attention’ and ‘yes, I tried to give my authentic first impressions’). Raters were recruited through Prolific Academic. We collected all data in May 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2.5 Participants\n",
    "\n",
    "We aimed to collect 100 raters per rating condition (to achieve stable averages and allow for exclusions), totalling 2100 raters. Altogether, 2115 raters completed the study. See Results for exclusions and demographics of the final sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3.1 Data Cleaning and Exclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.3.1.1 Models\n",
    "\n",
    "For data cleaning, we first downloaded and reshaped the raw data from Experimentum. In the next step, we ensured that the models’ gender, race/ethnicity, and units of height and weight were consistently formatted across labs. For gender and race/ethnicity, words presented in languages other than English were recoded to be presented in English (e.g., “mulher” to “female”, “preta” to “Black”). We then classified self-described race/ethnicity into one of seven categories (“White”, “Black”, “Asian”, “Indigenous”, “MENA” (Middle Eastern or North African), “Latine”, or “Mixed”), where possible. Descriptions that could not be clearly sorted into these categories were given “Ambiguous label” (non-entries were recoded as NA). For height, we ensured all data were presented in centimetres, and for weight, we ensured that all data were presented in kilograms. Models could report height and weight in metric or imperial units, so we converted from imperial to metric where required. We also sanity-checked the reported units, assuming heights \\> 100 to be in centimetres and those \\< 100 to be in inches, and weights \\< 80 to be in kilograms. Any non-entries of height or weight for a model was recoded as NA.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.3.1.2 Raters\n",
    "\n",
    "In the raters’ demographic questionnaire, we standardized participants’ recording of their race/ethnicity similarly to the models’ by recoding their inputs into one of seven categories (“White”, “Black”, “Asian”, “Indigenous/Pacific Islander”, “MENA” (Middle Eastern or North African), “Latine”, or “Mixed”), or as “Ambiguous label” when this was not possible. Any non-entries were recoded as NA.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.3.1.3 Data Exclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 2115 raters completed 2158 rating or categorisation tasks. We found that some raters did not complete all trials in tasks, some raters completed more than one task, and some raters completed more than the maximum number of trials in a task (likely by restarting the study or bypassing the back button block). Therefore, we removed incomplete tasks from our data, retained raters’ first complete tasks, and filtered our duplicate trials by keeping only raters’ first ratings for a duplicated trial. After these exclusions, and before implementing the pre-registered plan for data exclusions, we had complete and clean data from 1936 raters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our pre-registered plan for data exclusions included removing raters who gave overly consistent responses, committed overly fast responses, self-reported not taking the study seriously when asked whether or not they completed the study authentically, and failed attention checks. In total, we excluded 249 raters for our pre-registered reasons for data exclusions. <a href=\"#tbl-exclusions\" class=\"quarto-xref\">Table 3</a> shows the number of raters we excluded for each of our reasons."
